Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- gymnasium
- tensorflow
- numpy

Instructions:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install gymnasium tensorflow numpy`
2. Run the training notebook (training.ipynb) to train the agent. This will save the trained model in the `models/` folder.
3. Run the testing notebook (testing.ipynb) to evaluate the trained agent.

Ensure both notebooks are in the same directory as the `models/` folder.
